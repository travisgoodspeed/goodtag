Howdy y'all,

The RF430-TMPSNS-EVM is a passive RFID tag from Texas Instruments,
intended as a demo for temperature sensing.  As a target platform,
it's rather nice because it is a self contained board available
pre-assembled for just ten dollars.

In this directory, you will find the design files as distributed by
Texas Instruments.
