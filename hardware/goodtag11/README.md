Howdy y'all,

The GoodTag11 is my attempt at an NFC tag emulator, based around the
RF430FRL152H chip.

The passive values roughly come from the Texas Instruments reference
design in SLOA247C.  I've brought a few pins out unnecessarily, in
case bodge wires are needed, but they will be more firmly grounded in
future designs.

Manufacture in 2layers, 0.024" thickness, FR4-TG130, 1oz, Immersion
Silver, BLACK SOLDER MASK, TWO SIDE MASK, WHITE SILK SCREEN, TOP SILK,
Complex Shape, 8.560cm x 5.398cm.
